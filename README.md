JavaScript (ES6)

Key Features:

Dynamic DOM manipulation
Event-driven UI interactions
Conditional rendering logic
Scroll-triggered animations using the Intersection Observer API
Image transforms and transition effects
Clean, responsive layout structure

Project Objective:

This project was intentionally built to reinforce how JavaScript directly controls structure, styling, and user experience through the DOM.
It demonstrates my ability to implement logic-driven interactivity from scratch and build structured, maintainable frontend code without relying on external libraries.
